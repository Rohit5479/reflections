Q.1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

A.1) FC was used to find the difference between two versions of a file. I helped me in finding the bug as it showed the old and the new changed version of the code line.


Q.2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

A.2) It really works well, sometimes when I want to change the code for adding a new feature and I end up with lots of bugs then the history really works well to get back to the more stable code.

Q.3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

A.3) Manually choosing is good as we can commit only when few things are changed. Versions atomatically can be somethimes irksome as even for a small change it can commit.

Q.4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


A.4) Different files are important to one another so other files should also commit in git; in google doc files are independent so no need to commit for other files. 

Q.5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A.5) git log simply gives all the commits with there id while git diff is used along with the commit id to compare between two files and check out the changes.

Q.6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

A.6) I can easily check the diffrentce between the two files and find the bug or the changes that has been made.

Q.7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A.7) I want to use it for my codings but I wonder how I would!
